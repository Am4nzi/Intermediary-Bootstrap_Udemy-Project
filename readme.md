# Tindog: Tinder for Dogs

This is a small project I worked on in preperation I started studying a full-stack web development course at Spiced Academy [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), a coding bootcamp in Berlin.

This was a coding challenge which formed part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and the aim was to build a solid foundation in using CSS and bootstrap.
